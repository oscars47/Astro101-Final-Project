# Astro101-Final-Project
A repo for @ghirsch123 and @oscars47's astro101 final project (Phil Choi, Pomona College) using machine learning on variable stars.

## Project Goals:
1. We want to test the viability of 23 variability functions we explored over the summer via creating a neural network to classify the types of variable stars in the ASAS-SN data.
2. Once we have established a working trained model, then we can use this as a basis for performing unsupervised clustering in order to determine how our quantification tools developed with the supervised model translate to this unsupervised situation. 
3. Using what weâ€™ve learned with unsupervised clustering in step 2,we will  investigate some more well-studied class of variable object with distinct sub-classes (e.g., Cepheids).
4. Using our experience with step 3, we can apply these techniques to the Drake data to investigate contact binary features.
